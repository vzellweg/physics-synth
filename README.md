### Days 1 -2

#### What did I do?

I completed the "Basics" chapter of the three.js journey course, coding along with the course instructions. Tomorrow I will start to create my three.js hackathon project.

#### Any Trouble?

Not much trouble. Some of the concepts take a little while to understand. Other than that, the course has some review information but I can skip through it easily.

#### What did I learn?

I learned about scenes, animations, cameras, geometries, textures, and materials in three.js.

### Day 3

#### What did I do?

I took two more three.js journey lessons: Lights, and Shadows. I began work on my hackathon project and deployed my code to github pages. I also spent some time looking at color palettes, greensock tutorials, and the tone.js API. I learned what greensock timelines are, and I learned

#### Any Trouble?

Nope, so far anything too complex for me has not been critical to the project goals.

#### What did I learn?

I learned about lights and shadows in three.js. I learned how easy it is to deploy a static website using `gh-pages`. I learned a little

### Day 4

#### What did I do?

Started messing around with reflections, cubemaps, and animated lights.

#### Any Trouble?

Yes, keeping my scope limited and not getting distracted by cool new features. I think I'm managing well by using github issues religiously though.

#### What did I learn?

I started learning about using ray tracing to create interactive objects. I learned the process of creating cubemaps from hdri images.
