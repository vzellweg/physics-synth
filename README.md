## Journal

### Days 1 -2

#### What did I do?

I completed the "Basics" chapter of the three.js journey course, coding along with the course instructions. Tomorrow I will start to create my three.js hackathon project.

#### Any Trouble?

Not much trouble. Some of the concepts take a little while to understand. Other than that, the course has some review information but I can skip through it easily.

#### What did I learn?

I learned about scenes, animations, cameras, geometries, textures, and materials in three.js.
